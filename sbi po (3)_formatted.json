'We' does not agree with the verb '<b>was</b>' as the correct conjugation for the pronoun 'we' for the verb 'to be' is 'we were', and so 'was' will be changed to '<b>were</b>'. We infer that the 'we' will be not changed, as the correct emboldened part of the sentence tells us the author is talking in first person plural ['all of us'], and that's why 'we' will not be replaced by 'I'.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is option a).</p>"

        "solution": "<p>Option b) is grammatically and contextually correct. In option a), the verb 'feel' should be followed by the adjective 'appreciated' and not the verb 'appreciate'. Sense verbs like 'feel', 'sound', 'look', 'taste', 'appear', etc. are normally followed by adjectives. In option c), the auxiliary verb 'are' should be followed by the past participle verb 'considered' and not the base verb 'consider' because 'are' is followed by either present or past participle (here, the tense is not continuous so -ing forms of verbs cannot be used). In option d), the adverb 'physically' should be replaced by the adjective 'physical' to correctly qualify the noun 'development' because only adjectives can qualify the nouns.</p><p>Hence, the answer is option b).</p><p></p><p><b>NOTE:</b></p><p>Auxiliary verb: A verb that gives grammatical information that is not given by the main verb of a sentence. It supports the main verb. Auxiliary verbs help to form the various tenses, moods, and voices of other verbs. The principal ones are be, do, and have. Example: She will sing a song tomorrow. Here, 'will' is the auxiliary verb that supports the main verb 'sing'.</p><p>Participle: A word formed from a verb (e.g. going, gone, being, been) and used as an adjective (e.g. working woman, burnt toast) or a noun (e.g. good breeding). In English participles are also used to make compound verb forms (e.g. is going, has been). Consider the sentences given below:</p><p>Dancing at the party, the women fell on the ground.</p><p>Encouraged by her parents, Rita went on to pursue her passion.</p><p>The highlighted word in the first sentence is of the form Verb + ing and is used as a present participle. It is used to denote an action that is going on or incomplete or imperfect.</p><p>The highlighted word in the second sentence is of the form verb + ed. It is used as a past participle. It denotes completed action or state of the thing spoken of.</p><p>A past participle ends with the following: -ed, -d, -t, -en, or -n.</p><p>One should take great care and never get confused between a gerund and present participle. They use the same forms but perform different functions: a gerund is a verbal noun, while a present participle is a verbal adjective.</p>"
