So, we need to interchange the word 'impeccable' (faultless) with a noun that can be qualified by the adjective 'ruthless'. Among the underlined words, only 'venom' (something resembling or suggesting poison in its effect; spite; malice) is a noun. Accordingly, it is appropriate to interchange the word 'impeccable' (1) with the word 'venom' (3). There is no need to interchange other words as they are already placed correctly in the sentence. 'relentless' means unyieldingly severe, strict, or harsh. Hence, (e) is the correct answer. </p><p><b>The correct sentence is:</b> The ruthless venom in the critic's review sought to tear down the artist's impeccable work with relentless criticism.</p><p><b>Note:</b></p><p><b>Qualifiers: </b>A word or phrase that limits the meaning of another word or phrase or makes it less general.
