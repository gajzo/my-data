Its hymns are set to specific melodies using the seven basic notes (sapta svara: Sa, Ri, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni), which form the foundation of Indian classical music.</span><span style=\"font-family:'Cambria Math'\">The text is organized into sections called Gana (melody books) and Arcika (verse books), and the melodies are used in Vedic rituals, especially the Soma sacrifice. </span></p><p style=\"margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:8pt\"><span style=\"font-family:'Cambria Math'\">The chanting of Sama Veda verses is highly structured, involving intricate melodic patterns (ganas) and rhythmic cycles (talas), making it the earliest known source of organized music in India.</span><span style=\"font-family:'Cambria Math'\">The influence of the Sama Veda on Indian music is so profound that it is considered the origin of Indian classical music traditions.</span></p><p style=\"margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:8pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:'Cambria Math'\">The other Vedas</span><span style=\"font-family:'Cambria Math'\">—Rigveda, Yajurveda, and Atharvaveda—do not have this musical focus.</span></p>"
