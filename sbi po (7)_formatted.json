        "solution": "<p>The use of the noun 'improvement' after the country 'Nigeria' (singular noun) is incorrect as we require a verb at its place to denote an action regarding the noun 'research'. The use of 'found' is incorrect as the indefinite article a/an should be followed by a singular noun. 'Found' fits perfectly at first position as it denotes that the research had some findings (means 'information that is discovered as a result of research into something'), so 'A-D' will be swapped. The use of 'B' and 'C' is justifiable as 'greater access' suggests parents are getting more access to children's learnings and the use of 'children were learning' is also grammatically correct.</p><p>The correct order of rearrangement is DBCA.</p><p>The correct sentence is: Research in Nigeria found that giving parents greater access to what their children were learning led to an improvement in their commitment to learning online.</p><p>Hence, option (d) is correct.</p><p><b>NOTE/-</b></p><p><b>Subject-Verb Agreement:</b> Matching up singular or plural subjects with singular or plural forms of a verb is part of the process called agreement.

Consider the sentences given below: · To err is human. [like a noun, the infinitive 'to err' is the subject of the verb 'is'] · My father likes to cook. [like a noun, the infinitive 'to cook' is the object of the verb 'likes'] · To vote in elections is our right. [the infinitive 'to vote', like a noun, is the subject of the verb 'is', but, like a verb, it also takes an object (elections)] · Radha went to the lake to fetch water. [the infinitive 'to fetch', like a noun, is the object of the verb 'went', but, like a verb, it also takes an object (water)] · The above sentences illustrate various ways in which infinitives are used.

The first emboldened word should be an adjective that qualifies the noun \"form\" and starts with a vowel sound because it is preceded by the article \"an\". The only appropriate word that can be used with \"an\" which is also an adjective is \"extreme\". The second emboldened word should be another adjective defining the noun \"control\" and the most appropriate word is \"social\". The third emboldened word should be a verb or another adverb because it succeeds \"often\" which is an adverb. Also, the helping verb 'is' should be followed by the main verb in past participle (V3) or present participle (-ing) form. Therefore, the only suitable word is \"conducted.\" Finally, the last emboldened word must be the noun \"spectacle\" which follows the adjective \"public\" and precedes the preposition \"for.\" Hence, the correct sequence must be BADC.</p><p>The correct sentence is: Lynching is an extreme form of informal group social control, and it is often conducted with the display of a public spectacle for maximum intimidation.</p><p>Therefore, the correct answer is option b).</p>"

The old adage, \"You are what you eat,\" holds profound truth when we consider the intricate relationship between our dietary choices and the span of our lives. In an era where fast food is readily available and processed snacks <b>tempt</b> us at every turn, understanding the impact of nutrition on longevity becomes increasingly crucial. Longevity is not merely about extending the number of years we live but ensuring those years are filled with vitality and good health. Nutrition acts as a cornerstone in achieving this goal. A balanced diet, rich in whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains, provides the essential nutrients our bodies need to function optimally. Antioxidants found in colourful fruits and vegetables help combat oxidative stress, a major contributor to aging and chronic diseases. Omega-3 fatty acids, abundant in fatty fish like salmon and flaxseeds, offer anti-inflammatory benefits that support heart health and cognitive function, potentially extending our years of mental clarity and physical vigour.</p><p>Conversely, poor dietary choices laden with processed foods, sugars, and unhealthy fats can accelerate aging and predispose us to a host of diseases. Excessive consumption of refined carbohydrates and sugary beverages not only leads to weight gain and obesity but also increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The inflammatory response triggered by these dietary culprits not only compromises the immune system but also fuels the progression of chronic conditions, ultimately shortening our lifespan. Moreover, the impact of nutrition on longevity extends beyond the individual level to influence broader societal trends. In regions where access to nutritious food is limited, socioeconomic disparities often correlate with disparities in health outcomes and life expectancy. Addressing these inequities requires not only promoting nutritional education but also implementing policies that ensure equitable access to affordable, healthy food options for all segments of society.</p><p>Fortunately, awareness of the connection between nutrition and longevity is growing, prompting shifts in dietary habits and lifestyle choices.
