        "answer": "3",
        "solution": "<p>The passage clearly discusses the core challenge of programming AI to behave ethically through artificial empathy. </p><p>In the last paragraph, the author states: \"Empathy informs ethical behaviour by motivating actions that consider others' well-being. Can machines be programmed to act ethically through a form of artificial empathy? ... Encoding morality into algorithms is fraught with challenges: ethical principles vary across cultures, situations are often ambiguous, and machines lack intuition or conscience. Without true moral awareness, AI decisions might follow rules but miss the nuance required for genuine ethical understanding.\"</p><p>This directly supports option (c).</p><p><b>Hence, option (c) is the answer. </b></p><p>Option (a): Incorrect. The fourth paragraph states the opposite: machines are good at data analysis but lack depth in emotional understanding.</p><p>Reference excerpt - \"AI's ability to analyse vast data can also help identify subtle emotional states, enabling earlier intervention for mental health crises.\"</p><p>Option (b): Incorrect. This option contradicts the following excerpt from the second paragraph: \"Chatbots and virtual assistants, for example, are designed to detect certain keywords or emotional markers in speech or text and then respond with phrases intended to comfort or support.\"</p><p>Option (d): Incorrect. The last paragraph questions who should be accountable and implies that programmers and designers may bear responsibility.</p><p>Reference excerpt - \"When machines simulate empathy and make decisions affecting humans, who is accountable for the consequences? Designers, programmers, or the AI itself? This question highlights the need for careful oversight, clear guidelines, and ethical frameworks to govern AI development and deployment.\"</p><p>Option (e): Incorrect. The last paragraph explicitly mentions that AI has not yet achieved universal ethical decision-making.</p><p>Reference excerpt - \"Efforts are underway to integrate ethical reasoning into AI, allowing systems to make decisions aligned with human values. However, encoding morality into algorithms is fraught with challenges: ethical principles vary across cultures, situations are often ambiguous, and machines lack intuition or conscience.\"</p>"
