'Meek' is an adjective which means quite or gentle. 'Domesticate' is a verb which means cultivate or to raise. 'Absolutely' is an adverb which means completely.</p><p>So, the correct pair of words will be 'spread, domesticate'.</p><p>Hence, option (d) is the correct choice.</p><p><b>Infinitive: </b>The infinitive is the base form of a verb, often preceded by to.</p><p>Consider the sentences given below:</p><p>· To err is human. [like a noun, the infinitive 'to err' is the subject of the verb 'is']</p><p>· My father likes to cook. [like a noun, the infinitive 'to cook' is the object of the verb 'likes']</p><p>· To vote in elections is our right. [the infinitive 'to vote', like a noun, is the subject of the verb 'is', but, like a verb, it also takes an object (elections)]</p><p>· Radha went to the lake to fetch water. [the infinitive 'to fetch', like a noun, is the object of the verb 'went', but, like a verb, it also takes an object (water)]</p><p>· The above sentences illustrate various ways in which infinitives are used. It can both act as a noun and a verb.</p><p><b>Parallelism:</b> In grammar, parallelism, also known as parallel structure or parallel construction, is a balance within one or more sentences of similar phrases or clauses that have the same grammatical structure. Given below is an example which shows a sentence in two forms (parallel in structure and lacking parallelism): Lacking parallelism: Prerna likes cooking, dancing and to sing.

        "question": "<strong>Directions:</strong><br><p><b>Directions : </b>Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow.</p><p>Personal development covers activities that improve awareness and identity, develop talents and potential, build human capital and <b>facilitate</b> employability, enhance the quality of life and contribute to the realization of dreams and aspirations. Personal development takes place over the course of a person's entire life. Not limited to self-help, the concept involves formal and informal activities for developing others in roles such as teacher, guide, counsellor, manager, life coach or mentor. When personal development takes place in the context of institutions, it refers to the methods, programs, tools, techniques, and assessment systems that support human development at the individual level in organizations.</p><p>Personal development as stated above can also include developing other people. This may take place through roles such as those of a teacher or mentor, either through a personal competency (such as the alleged skill of certain managers in developing the potential of employees) or through a professional service (such as providing training, assessment or coaching). Beyond improving oneself and developing others, \"personal development\" labels a field of practice and research. As a field of practice, personal development includes personal-development methods, learning programs, assessment systems, tools, and techniques. As a field of research, personal-development topics appear in psychology journals, education research, management journals and books, and human-development economics. Any sort of development - whether economic, political, biological, organisational or personal - requires a framework if one wishes to know whether a change has actually occurred. In the case of personal development, an individual often functions as the primary judge of improvement or of regression, but validation of objective improvement requires assessment using standard criteria.</p><p>The key to managing one's own personal development is knowing one's own strengths and areas for improvement. Knowing these can help develop weaknesses and turn them into strengths. An <b>accurate</b> self-analysis will give room for improvement and it is important to be totally honest with oneself in order to improve on some of the biggest weaknesses.</p><p>Personal development can increase your productivity. Becoming aware of one's strengths and weaknesses can encourage one to produce higher quality work - seeing improvement can give one a little confidence boost and motivation to achieve more! It can also guide one to develop one's weaknesses into strengths. For example, a poor attitude can be turned into a positive one - this can be achieved by recognising the impact and consequences of one's attitude and how it can affect others. It's certainly not easy but becoming more aware of how others respond to or absorb the mood/behaviour may encourage one to control it - or even turn it into a positive attitude in order to encourage others in the workplace!</p><br><br><p>Which of the following is the closest antonym of the word 'facilitate' as given in the passage?</p>",
