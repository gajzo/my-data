Life satisfaction is a cognitive, global evaluation of the quality of your life. It is a more <b>robust</b> measure of well-being, in part because it is less subject to mood fluctuations. Life satisfaction is associated with better physical health, higher performance, and stronger social relationships. A periodic assessment of your life satisfaction provides you with a mirror on which you can reflect your accomplishments, your desires, and your unfulfilled needs all at once. It provides a global picture of your progress in life in relation to your own expectations. The research on life satisfaction reveals that how satisfied you are with your life is influenced by two important factors - your personality and your satisfaction in specific areas in your life.</p><p>There is some evidence that suggests different personality types report different levels of life satisfaction. Extroverted types report higher satisfaction with life, while people who are high in negativity report lower satisfaction. However, personality alone does not explain the whole story. Do not forget that the way we currently measure personality depends on your self-assessment of how you feel, think, and react in certain situations. As a result, if you tend to view yourself and the world in a negative light on a personality test, you are more likely to maintain that same negative view when you think about your life overall as well. The second factor is a lot more influential and makes more sense. Your overall life satisfaction is to a large extent determined by your satisfaction in specific areas in your life. These domain-specific satisfaction ratings collectively influence your total satisfaction with life - and consequently the quality of your life. There is a caveat, however: What matters most for your overall life satisfaction is how satisfied you are in areas of your life that you deem more important.</p><br><br><p>Which of the following words is the synonym of the word 'robust' that is emboldened in the passage?</p>",
