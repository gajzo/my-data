        "solution": "<p>The sentence with blank A describes an ongoing fact about socio-economic factors acting as threats to agriculture and food security. Since the subject (\"Global warming, water scarcity, population growth, rising food prices, urbanization, and other socio-economic factors\") is plural, the verb must agree with it.

Also, as a verb, it does not fit the blank as it is a singular verb, and we require a plural verb. </p><p>\"Imposed\" - Incorrect, as it is in the past tense and does not match the present-tense context of the sentence.</p><p>\"Prose\" - Incorrect, as it is a noun referring to written or spoken language, irrelevant here.</p><p>\"Possessing\" - Incorrect, as it is the present participle form, which does not fit grammatically.

        "question": "<strong>Directions:</strong><br><p><b>Directions :</b> Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow.</p><p>Recently, America's surgeon-general called vaping an epidemic among young people, criticising in particular products with \"kid-friendly\" flavours, such as cinnamon and vanilla. Many countries, including India, have already banned e-cigarettes. The devices use an electric charge to vaporise a dose of nicotine (accompanied, often, by various flavouring chemicals). The composition of the vapour varies between brands. Its main ingredients - propylene glycol and glycerol - are thought to be mostly <b>harmless</b> when inhaled. But that is not certain. Nitrosamines, a carcinogenic family of chemicals, have been found in e-cigarette vapour, albeit at levels low enough to be deemed insignificant. Metallic particles from the device's heating element, such as nickel and cadmium, are also a concern. High exposure to these can increase the risk of cancer. Some studies have found that the vapour contains high levels of nasty chemicals such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acrolein, all derived from the other ingredients that have been exposed to high temperatures. It also contains free radicals, compounds that get readily oxidised and can damage tissue or DNA. Then there is nicotine. Besides being addictive, it is known to have an adverse effect all around the body. The main concern is its effects on children. Work in animals suggests that exposure to nicotine at an early age could make users more susceptible to other addictive substances later in life.</p><p>This sounds worrying, but e-cigarettes are nowhere near as nasty as their combustible cousins. Cigarette smoke contains about 70 carcinogens, as well as carbon monoxide (a poison), particulates, toxic heavy metals such as cadmium and arsenic, oxidising chemicals and many other organic compounds. Instead of the thousands of different compounds in cigarette smoke, e-cigarette vapour probably contains merely hundreds. And cigarettes may be more addictive than some e-cigarettes because they deliver other chemicals along with nicotine. For example, tobacco smoke amplifies the addictive nature of nicotine by inhibiting monoamine oxidase, an enzyme that helps break down the dopamine (a pleasure hormone) that nicotine releases in the brain.</p><p>Regulators and politicians are right to worry about the long-term effects of e-cigarettes, but widespread bans risk forgoing the potential health benefits of people turning to e-cigarettes as a substitute for the conventional sort.
