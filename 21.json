Here, a noun would fit aptly to complete it meaningfully. 'His support' shows that 'support' is already a noun (indicated by the use of possessive adjective/determiner -his), so the use of 'reformer' [noun] is redundant. Here, a preposition can fit to connect the two parts of the sentence. Also, a participle form of the verb is required after 'has' so the use of word (C) - noun will be incorrect. Word (E) which is a past participle form of the verb should be a noun as 'confusion' is already a noun (negative word) and also as per the rule of <b>parallelism</b> (Parallel structure means using the same pattern of words to show that two or more ideas have the same level of importance).
