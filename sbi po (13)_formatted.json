Consider the sentences given below: <b>Dancing </b>at the party, the woman fell on the ground. <b>Encouraged</b> by her parents, Rita went on to pursue her passion. The highlighted word in the first sentence is of the form Verb + ing and is used as a present participle. It is used to denote an action that is going on or incomplete or imperfect. The highlighted word in the second sentence is of the form verb + ed. It is used as a past participle. It denotes the completed action or state of the thing spoken of. A past participle ends with the following: -ed, -d, -t, -en, or -n. One should take great care and never get confused between a gerund and present participle.

        "solution": "<p>Seven people namely A, B, C, D, E, F and G are sitting around a circular table to discuss the Olympic games. Some are facing inside, and some are facing outside the circular table. Each has a different duration (in seconds) to speak i.e., 12, 15, 26, 29, 33, 41 and 47. No two people speak for the same duration of time. More people face inside the circle than people face outside the circle.</p><p>Two people sit between A and the one who speaks for 33 seconds. So, there are two cases possible i.e., Case 1 and Case 2. </p><p></p><p>B sits immediately right of the one who speaks for 33 seconds, where both B and the one who speaks for 33 seconds face in the opposite direction. So, case 1 and Case 2 will further have two cases i.e., Case 1(a), Case 1(b), Case 2(a) and Case 2(b). </p><p></p><p>C, who speaks for 29 seconds, sits third to the right of B. A speaks 3 seconds less than B. So, there is only one possibility i.e., A speaks for 12 seconds, and B speaks for 15 seconds. </p><p></p><p>E, who faces outside the circle, sits third to the left of the one who speaks for 41 seconds. D and K sit adjacent to each other. K speaks for 33 seconds. E sits adjacent to A and B. So, Case 1(b) and Case 2(b) will be invalid.</p><p></p><p>G speaks for 26 seconds. D speaks 6 seconds less than E. C faces outside the circle. So, Case 2(a) will be invalid. </p><p><b></b></p><p>Finally, we get, </p><p><b></b></p><br/><p>The one who speaks for 41 seconds sits fourth to the right of A.</p><br>https://u1.oliveboard.in/exams/solution/oliveimg/p25571/image001.png<br>https://u1.oliveboard.in/exams/solution/oliveimg/p25571/image002.png<br>https://u1.oliveboard.in/exams/solution/oliveimg/p25571/image003.png<br>https://u1.oliveboard.in/exams/solution/oliveimg/p25571/image004.png<br>https://u1.oliveboard.in/exams/solution/oliveimg/p25571/image005.png<br>https://u1.oliveboard.in/exams/solution/oliveimg/p25571/image006.png"
